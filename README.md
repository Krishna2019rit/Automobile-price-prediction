# Abstract
Due to the numerous elements that influence the price of a used vehicle on the market, determining if the quoted price of a used car is accurate is a difficult undertaking. The goal of this project is to create machine learning models that may be used in a variety of situations.

can properly forecast the price of a used car based on its qualities, allowing them to make well-informed decisions.

We use a dataset of sale prices to construct and evaluate several learning algorithms.

Various makes and models are available in different cities across the United States. Our findings reveal that Random Forest is a good fit for us.

The best results are obtained using model and K-Means clustering with linear regression, although they are computationally intensive.

Traditional linear regression produced good results as well, with the added benefit of a substantially cheaper cost.
